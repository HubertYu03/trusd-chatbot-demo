Smythe also offers family education opportunities such as s community-based English classes for adults through TRUSD Adult Education, citizenship classes, CAASPP for parents, infant/toddler parenting classes, and evening events like Knights of the Round Table, Coffee with the Principal, science, reading, and art nights. While we certainly have amazing teachers, the power of what happens in the classroom comes from the strength of individual teachers working as part of a team, connecting teacher strengths with student needs and working collaboratively to talk about teaching and learning, all with the goal of improving the academic achievement of our students. ",
