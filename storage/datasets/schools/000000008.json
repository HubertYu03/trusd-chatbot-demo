Joyce, we work extremely hard to meet the needs of all students. Our mission is to have all students make at least one year's worth of academic gains annually, to provide a nurturing environment where ALL are respected and valued, and to foster partnerships with families and the community that support students.\n\nThe whole staff considers every student as “our” student. Grade-level teams collaborate and share strategies on a weekly basis and engage in regular professional development. We hold a number of family involvement events each year, including our monthly family Friday read-ins, coffee and conversation with the principal, and Winter Festival. ",
