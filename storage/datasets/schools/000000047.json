	"description": "At Westside Elementary, we know all our students can achieve high levels of proficiency. Our school’s greatest asset is its dedicated and talented staff. We meet regularly in Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) to analyze data with the sole purpose of driving instruction to meet the needs of each child. In addition, grade-level teams collaborate and share best practice strategies, and we have focused on professional development throughout the year to support the adopted curriculum and 21st Century Learning. Most importantly, our teachers and staff take responsibility for every child who attends Westside\nSchool. ",
