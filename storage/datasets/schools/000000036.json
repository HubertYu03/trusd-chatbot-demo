	"description": "Regency Park promotes the inclusion of our students by focusing on meeting their academic, social and emotional needs. Each month, Regency Park focuses on a character trait that good citizens exemplify. Our student leadership team also focuses on good citizenship, organizing many opportunities to donate food and clothing to those less fortunate. Here at Regency, we fully embrace Project Based Learning, a teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to authentic, engaging and complex questions, problems, or challenges. As a culminating activity, each grade level provides an evening presentation for their families. Last, but not least, the staff at Regency Park understand the need for fun! The Regency Park community participates in Spirit Days, Afternoon Sing, and many fun events put on by our Parent Teacher Association (PTA), including movie and craft nights. ",
